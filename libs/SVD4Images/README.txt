Uses Java 1.4.2, may not work with earlier versions.

The JAR file SVD4Images.jar is a java executable JAR that may be run
from the command line using "java -jar SVD4Images.jar" assuming Java is
setup on the computer. The JAR will then execute an example application
using the SVD compression algorithm. The JAR requires the three images 
below to be in the same folder as it to run correctly.

sunset.jpg
einstein.jpg

Also available in the JAR are the EncodeSVD and DecodeSVD applications
which allow you to encode or decode images to an SVD compressed image
file.

EncodeSVD may be run by typing "java -cp SVD4Images.jar EncodeSVD"

DecodeSVD may be run by typing "java -cp SVD4Images.jar DecodeSVD"

Upon running either of these application you will be prompted for the
input needed.
